# BioPairwiseOptimization

This is an educational project which aims to rewrite parts of functionalities from pairwise2 module from BioPython library. Pairwise2 module provides methods for finding global and local alignments in string sequences, which are commonly used in bioinformatics. Idea for optimizing this module appeared after discovering that some of it methods are often considerably slow for big inputs.
